#  Find the Parity Outlier
#  Date: 5/16
#  Instructions: You are given an array (which will have a length of at least 3, 
#  but could be very large) containing integers. The array is either entirely 
#  comprised of odd integers or entirely comprised of even integers except for a 
#  single integer N. Write a method that takes the array as an argument and returns 
#  this "outlier" N.

def find_outlier(integers):
    odd = []
    even = []
    
    for i in integers:
        if i % 2 == 0:
            even.append(i)
        else:
            odd.append(i)
    if len(even) == 1:
        return even[0]
    else:
        return odd[0]
